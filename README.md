# tickIT

## What is this?

I'm creating a little project for me and Tim to use at the library. It's basically just an IT ticketing system. But I also hope it becomes a useful partner for troubleshooting. By collecting structured data on issues with the library's tech, maybe we can observe patterns and quickly access reliable fixes. So yes, it's a system for tracking specific issues with the library's IT system. But it also aspires to be a system for developing knowledge about that system.

I will be the only eyes on the project during these very early days. And once I get a prototype running, I'll share it with Tim. We will spend time using it and honing it until we've worked through the majority of bugs and security issues.

There's also the question of where/how to host/run this thing. I'd love to just self-host this puppy from a server in house. That would be ideal in my view. But maybe some managed service would be better. Still need to explore our options there.

Cost of development and maintenance? Should be very low. I'm not dropping any other work at the library to do this. And I'm working on it in my own time. So there's no real cost of labor from the library. But with hosting, that might become something to discuss. I can't expect it to be very expensive. I think Porkbun PHP hosting is like $12 per month.

## Why bother?

A few reasons:
1. Because this is personally gratifying work. I enjoy coding and want to do this.
2. Because I feel that the way we receive and track tech issues at the library is cumbersome (I'm looking at you email). I'd like a streamlined process that has some cumulative effect.
3. Because I don't want to use big-box or proprietary stuff. I don't want the library to spend any real money on this. And I don't want us to use more Google or Microsoft products.
4. Because I also have dreams of pulling in contributors from the community. Maybe we can even partner with the high school (or younger) students nearby to get them working on a real project. Getting hands on experience with a software project that people actually use would be invaluable for students. It's unfortunate that it's not a public facing thing, but we can only start where we can. Maybe this can lead to other fun stuff!

## Okay but how?

That's being worked out as we speak. So far, I know the tech stack is going to include PHP and mariaDB (mySQL). That's all I got so far.
